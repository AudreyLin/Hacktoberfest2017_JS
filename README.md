My 1st Program_JS_Hacktoberfest2017


This was my first JavaScript Program.  I had to write it for a pull request, but I didn't do the files correctly, so I am posting it here.  Total noob, but it was fun.  The task was to write a simple program, but I didn't want to just do the "Hello World", so I made a pop-up alert, and tried to make it decent looking for a first project. Lol.  I'll get better at this, I am having fun learning the front-end.  I really want to learn the server-side web development, too.  Eventually, I want to develop software and business intelligence applications.  
I have my degrees in IT Networking (A.A.) and IT Security (B.S), but programming is really fun, so I want to eventually tie all of this together.  It is going to be fun, well it already is.
