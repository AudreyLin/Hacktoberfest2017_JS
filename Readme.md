Hi.  I just did this project as part of one my pull requests for Hacktoberfest2017.  
However, I submitted the code in one page, and wanted to load my files correctly, so that is basically the only purpose of this repo.  
I'm a noob.  I'm still learning.  I'll get the hang of this soon.  I'll be a  minute, or 20...lol.  The project is pretty basic, but 
like I said, I'm a noob, and just wanted to more than just add my name to a list (which I did, also).  So, I'll make better stuff, give me time: I'll get there.  Lol.
